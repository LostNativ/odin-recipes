    <h3>Boerewors Rolls</h3>
    <p>Boerewors is based on an older traditional 
        Dutch sausage called the verse worst, though it
         differs somewhat in its ingredients. 
         In South Africa, Boerewors is as 
         traditional as you can get and it is 
         hard to imagine a sports event, farmerâ€™s 
         market or school fete without
         someone selling Boerewors Rolls 
         aka "Worsbroodjies".</p>
